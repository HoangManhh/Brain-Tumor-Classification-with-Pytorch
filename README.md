# Brain-Tumor-Classification-with-Pytorch
Inspired from this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XUvrrpt54Lc
I try to build a simple CNN model with Pytorch for brain tumor classification. You can get the Brain tumor image dataset from here: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedhamada0/brain-tumor-detection
